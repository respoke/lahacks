We're really excited at the opportunity to help all the teams of the 2015 [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com/) hackathon series add real-time communications to their apps, something that we feel will revolutionize the way people communicate!\r\n\r\n##What is Respoke and how can it help?\r\n[Respoke](http://respoke.io) is a platform created to help developers easily add real-time communications features to their applications. You'll notice I used the word \"feature\", and this is an important distinction as we think that communication should be a native part of every application and website, not just a separate tool. \r\n\r\n##How do you I use Respoke in my applications?\r\nWe currently offer a Javascript library that allows you to easily implement things like real-time voice and video, as well as messaging and data sharing functionality into your applications.\r\n\r\n##Let's see some examples!\r\nLet's say you want to add **messaging** capabilities to your app (maybe for support purposes,or maybe just to allow your users to communication with each other). You can do this by connecting to Respoke and using the sendMessage method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// make an endpoint for that recipient\r\nvar endpoint = client.getEndpoint({ id: \"remoteUserID\" });\r\n\r\n// send the message\r\nendpoint.sendMessage({ message : \"myMessage\" });\r\n```              \r\n\r\nHow about making an **Audio Call**?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Call somebody when the makeCall button is clicked\r\n$(\"#makeCall\").click(function () {\r\n    var endpoint = client.getEndpoint({ id: \"remoteUserID\" });\r\n    call = endpoint.startAudioCall();\r\n    call.listen('hangup', function () {\r\n        call = null;\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Hang up on them when the endCall button is clicked\r\n$(\"#endCall\").click(function () {\r\n    if (call) {\r\n        call.hangup();\r\n        call = null;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#How to get started:\r\nFirst thing you'll need to do is create a free Respoke developer account at [https://www.respoke.io/](https://www.respoke.io/). After completing the form, you'll receive a confirmation email with a link to complete your registration.\r\n\r\nAfter you're all signed up, check out our [Docs and Quickstart Guide](https://docs.respoke.io/) for a fast run-down on getting started. You can also find lot's of useful information in our [Javascript Reference](https://docs.respoke.io/js-library/respoke.html). \r\n\r\n#Need Help?\r\nBefore the hackathon, you can get answers to your pressing questions on the [Respoke Community Forums](http://community.respoke.io/). During the hackathon, our Developer Evangelist Kyle Tyacke ([@geekgonenomad](https://twitter.com/geekgonenomad)) will be on-hand to help answer any questions you might have.\r\n\r\n#Good luck!\r\nFrom the entire Respoke team, we want to wish you all the best of luck at the hackathon and can't wait to see what you build!
